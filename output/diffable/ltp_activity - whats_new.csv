Learning is fun! 🎓

❓ Ask your children to think of a new, fun skill you could learn together. 
For example, keeping a ball in the air with your foot, learning and practising local language phrases, sharing stories from your culture, playing local games and sports, or learning a new song."

💛 Approach learning the skill in a kind and fun way, and do not judge your children or yourself for your ability in the skill."
