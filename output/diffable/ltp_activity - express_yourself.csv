Dancing makes people happy!
🌈 This game can be played in pairs or as a group - stand facing each other or in a circle.
🎵 Together, choose a song, a fun sound, or a clapping pattern to follow and choose a person to start the game by creating one dance move.
👀 The person to their right must copy that dance move and add their own move to it.
✨ Go around the circle, each person adding a new dance move."

🎉 Have fun trying out new dance moves with this game!"
