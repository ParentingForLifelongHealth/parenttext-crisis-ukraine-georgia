Exercise is a great way to spend time together, and it is so good for your health🌱. Find an exercise activity that both you and your children want to do and try it out together! Be mindful of the safety of the space you are using for exercise. 

⏰ Even walking for 10 minutes a day is good for you. 
⚽Together, try walking, running, stretching, playing games like hide-and-seek, or any other physical activities you enjoy."
msg._Together_think,send_message,msg.Get_ActiveExerc,"🏆 Together, think of ways to make it even more fun. Can you run to a certain point? Take turns being the coach? Can there be a small, free reward like getting to decide the next activity?
Exercise becomes easier and more enjoyable the more you do it. 
🔄 If you or your children do not like the first type of exercise you pick, try a new way to exercise."
